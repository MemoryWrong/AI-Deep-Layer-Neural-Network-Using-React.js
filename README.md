# Single Layer NeuralNetwork (Linear Regression)
this is demo visualise the output of neural network using p5.js
1. Provding the data sample array with expected results of 1/0.
2. Generate the neural network and building learning system with learning rate of 0.05.
3. Generate the random points to let AI NN system to give prediction.
4. Using react js and chart js to visualise the data results.

## Implementation of Matrix Library

```
1. Algorithm of single perceptron network
2. DNN (to do) 
3. RNN (to do)
4. Multi-layer NN
5. Matrix ( + - * )

```

## Run the demo

```
1. npm install
2. node server.js
3. open localhost:3001 in the browser
